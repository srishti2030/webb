        <h1>Launchers</h1>
        <p>Launchers or Launch Vehicles are used to carry spacecraft to space. India has three active operational launch vehicles: Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk-III (LVM3).</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>PSLV is configured with four variants like 6,4,2 solid rocket strap-on motors& core alone versions. Variants will be chosen based on the payload weights & orbit to be accomplished. PSLV has been a versatile launch vehicle deployed for launching all the three types of payloads viz. Earth Observation, Geo-stationary and Navigation. It has got highest success rate and considered as work horse of ISRO.GSLV with indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has enabled the launching up to 2 tonne class of communication satellites.</p>
        <p>The LVM3 is the next generation launch vehicle capable of launching 4 tonne class of communication satellites and 10 tonne class of payloads to LEOs. The vehicle was developed with completely indigenized technologies including the C25 cryo stage. The launch vehicle has a track record of all successful launches even from the first development flight. The Human rated LVM3 is identified as the launch vehicle for Gaganyaan mission, which is named as HRLV.</p>
        <p>The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is being developed with complete indigenous technologies to meet the small satellite launch market on demand driven basis</p>
        <p>In order to achieve high accuracy in placing satellites into their orbits, a combination of accuracy, efficiency, power and immaculate planning are required. ISRO's Launch Vehicle Programme spans numerous centres. Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, located in Thiruvananthapuram, is responsible for the design and development of launch vehicles. Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre and ISRO Propulsion Complex, located at Valiamala and Mahendragiri respectively, develop the liquid and cryogenic stages for these launch vehicles. Satish Dhawan Space Centre, SHAR, is the space port of India and is responsible for integration of launchers. It houses two operational launch for launching ISRO's launch vehicles.</p>

        <h1>Training</h1>
        <p>The ISRO centres offer training to industries, professionals, government officials, teachers, students and general public in the space applications, satellite building etc. Some of the training programs are also available for international students.</p>
        <h2>Indian Institution of Remote Sensing (IIRS) DHERADUN</h2>
        <p>IRS is a premier institute primarily focussing on training in GeoSpatial applications.</p>
        <p>The training and capacity building programmes of the Institute are designed to meet the requirements of various target/user groups, i.e., for professionals at working, middle and supervisory levels, fresh graduates, researchers, academia and decision makers. The duration of courses ranges from one-week to two-years. The programmes are meticulously designed by the domain experts, and are then approved by the Board of Studies (BoS) and Academic Council (AC) consisting of eminent subject experts. A team of sixty-four dedicated scientists at IIRS contribute in delivering the course contents. Guest faculties from reputed organizations/institutes in the country and abroad are regularly invited to share their knowledge and experience with the course participants.</p>
        <p>The training and education programmes conducted by the Institute include educational programmes, Training programmes and e-learning programmes.</p>
        <h2>Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahemdabad</h2>
        <p><b>Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) </b>is a National Research Institute for space and allied sciences, supported mainly by Department of Space, Government of India. This research laboratory has ongoing research programmes in astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and aeronomy, Earth sciences, Solar System studies and theoretical physics. The initial focus was research on cosmic rays and the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical physics and radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
        <p>Today PRL is involved in research, related to five major fields of science. PRL is also instrumental in the PLANEX planetary science and exploration programme.</p>
        <p>PRL also offers various fellowships, internships and project training courses.</p>

        <h1>Outreach</h1>
        <p>The Department of space has been engaging students, academicians, enthusiasts and all other stakeholders in its programmes. On regular basis the outreach programmes are conducted on the creations of national science Day and world space week.Major centres have got space exhibitions that visitors can visit on working days.
        </p>
        <p>Capacity Building Programme Office considers outreach as one of the major activities. The details of are here
            IIRS conducts E-learning programmes on various topics and themes. Here are the details
            Additionally, following are the specific Outreach activities.</p>
        <h2>PRL Open House Exhibition</h2>
        <p>To share and spread the awareness about science and research in society an open house exhibition is being organised at PRL, Ahmedabad from time to time.</p>
        <h2>Vikram Sarabhai Competition for Concept-Essay Writing (VOICE)</h2>
        <p>This essay competition is organised by PRL, Ahmedabad. Standard 8-10 students of the country can participate in this</p>
        <h2>Science Express</h2>
        <p>A team from PRL organises science exhibition/demonstrations at different places of Gujarat and Rajasthan in coordination with schools/community science centersto reach out to the school and college students with an emphasis on the underprivileged students and also the girl students of rural background and the general public to share the excitement of science.</p>
        <h2>World Space Week at VSSC:</h2>
        <p>World Space Week consists of space education and outreach events held by space agencies, aerospace companies, schools, planetaria, museums, and astronomy clubs around the world in a common timeframe. World Space Week is coordinated by the United Nations with the support of the World Space Week Association (WSWA) The WSWA leads a global team of National Coordinators, who promote the celebration of World Space Week within their own countries. The details of celebrations at VSSC are here.</p>
        <h2>National Science Day at URSC</h2>
        <p>To celebrate this discovery of "Raman Effect" and to create scientific awareness among the school children, National Science Day (NSD) is celebrated every year on February 28, at URSC. Various events are organised during the NSD for the school students which are aimed to infuse the spirit of scientific reasoning in the young minds. The announcement is made, normally, during February every year. The details are here</p>
